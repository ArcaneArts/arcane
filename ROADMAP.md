# Roadmap

* [x] Imperative Routing with Widgets instead of string named routes, but with the benefits of named routes such as path variables, query parameters and url generation.
* [x] Authentication via IAM / Email Password UI only, but provide an authentication package that can be used with the login UI
* [ ] Fully functional VFS browser, with picker support & preview support
* [x] Chat UI fully customizable, with support for custom message types, and new layout types
* [ ] A service package `arcane_fluf` to provide a service layer for Firebase Auth, Firestore & Storage
